# patterns-snippets-tools
Contains personal snippets, patterns, and tools used in software.

They are sorted by technology (language) and then sorted by specific product (software application).

# Examples

If I write a python pattern then it would have its own place in the Python folder.

If I write a C# snippet that is only applicable for use with ESRI's ArcGIS Pro, then it will be in the Application Specific folder, then the ArcGIS Pro Folder, then in the C# folder.
